# Bird Match 🐦

**Bird Match** is a responsive, browser-based quiz game designed to help users learn to identify common birds by name and image. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a personal design and development project focused on interactivity, accessibility, and educational fun.

**Live version:** [https://birdmatch.netlify.app](https://birdmatch.netlify.app)

## 🐤 Features

- Randomized bird matching game with:
  - High-quality bird photos
  - Multiple-choice options for each question
  - Immediate feedback on correct and incorrect answers
  - Birding tips for correct identification
- Score tracking and high score persistence
- Modal feedback system
- Page transitions for start, game, game over, and about/credits
- Fully mobile-responsive layout

## 🛠 Built With

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling (including `clamp()` for fluid typography and layout)  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for game logic and DOM manipulation  
- **Netlify** for deployment  

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main game layout and sections  
- `styles.css` — All visual styling, typography, and responsiveness  
- `script.js` — Core game logic and event handling  
- `birdData.js` — Bird image data, names, options, and tips  
- `assets/` — Bird photos, background art, and font files  

## 📚 What I Learned

- Managing game state in vanilla JavaScript  
- Creating dynamic, responsive layouts with `clamp()` and `flexbox`  
- Building custom modal systems and score logic  
- Organizing code into reusable functions  
- Designing for clarity, fun, and adaptability across devices  

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an ongoing project. Future improvements will include:

- 🧠 Randomized multiple-choice answer order (to avoid pattern memorization)
- 🗂 More bird images and regional variations
- 🎵 Ambient sound or subtle background audio for immersion
- 🧪 Accessibility improvements and keyboard navigation support

Feel free to follow the project to track updates!
